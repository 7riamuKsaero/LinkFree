One of the advantages of Acronis True Image 2018 is that it can create a bootable ISO image that you can use to start your computer in case of a system failure or a ransomware attack. You can also use this ISO image to perform various backup and recovery tasks without installing the software on your computer. However, to use this feature, you need to have a valid license key for Acronis True Image 2018.
 
If you don't have a license key, you can try to use a crack that can activate the software for free. However, this is not recommended, as it may expose your computer to malware, viruses, or legal issues. Moreover, using a crack may not guarantee the full functionality and reliability of the software. Therefore, it is better to purchase a genuine license key from the official website of Acronis.
 
If you still want to use a crack, you need to follow these steps:
 
1. Download the Acronis True Image 2018 ISO Bootable Crack Full Download from a reliable source. Make sure you scan it with an antivirus program before opening it.
2. Extract the files from the archive and run the setup.exe file. Follow the instructions to install the software on your computer.

4. Run the software and enter any serial number when asked. The crack should activate the software and bypass the license verification.
5. To create a bootable ISO image, open the software and click on Tools. Then click on Rescue Media Builder and select Acronis Bootable Rescue Media. Choose ISO as the output format and select a location to save the file. Click on Proceed to start the process.
6. Once the ISO image is created, you can burn it to a CD/DVD or a USB flash drive using any burning software. You can also mount it as a virtual drive using any mounting software.
7. To boot from the ISO image, you need to change the boot order in your BIOS settings. Restart your computer and press the appropriate key to enter the BIOS setup. Usually, it is F2, F10, F12, or Del. Then go to the Boot tab and select CD/DVD or USB as the first boot option. Save and exit the BIOS setup.
8. Your computer should now boot from the ISO image and launch Acronis True Image 2018. You can use it to backup or restore your system or files as needed.
